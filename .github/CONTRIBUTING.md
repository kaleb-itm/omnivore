📝 **Guidelines for Contribution**

Hello there! When contributing to Omnivore, it's essential to maintain a style consistent with the file you're editing. You can quickly check if your code aligns with our style by running `yarn lint`. Your attention to detail here is appreciated! 😊

📜 **License**

Omnivore is proudly licensed under the [AGPL license](https://github.com/omnivore-app/omnivore/blob/main/LICENSE). Let's keep our code open and accessible to all!

🤝 **CLA (Contributor License Agreement)**

We kindly request all contributors to adhere to Omnivore's CLA, which you can review and accept at [Omnivore's CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/omnivore-app/omnivore). Your commitment to this agreement is much appreciated.

👩‍💻 **Code Review**

Before merging any pull request, we require a code review from one of our trusted [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/omnivore-app/omnivore/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS). It ensures the quality and integrity of our codebase.

🧪 **Testing**

We take quality seriously! Pull requests automatically undergo testing using GitHub Actions. We typically merge a pull request only if it passes all our tests without causing any regressions. 🧪

📬 **Submitting a Pull Request**

- **New Contributors**: If you're a new contributor, GitHub may request permissions on the pull request to run tests. Don't worry, our maintainer will swiftly approve the test run if your patch looks promising.

- **Previous Contributors**: For those who've contributed before, GitHub will kick off testing as soon as a test machine is available.

Once your pull request passes the tests, it'll be promptly reviewed, merged, and deployed by one of our diligent maintainers. We usually deploy changes around ten times a day, so your contributions will go live quickly! 🚀
